From here on, on my offshoot, we'll start at 1.7x.xxxxxxxx. The format is version.subversion.date_of_build. A beta will be b1.7x.xxxxxxxx.

Ver 1.70.12252004

Notes: I actually compiled this back in August when I was working with Bob Bailey. I then sold my 1991 Eagle Talon and sat on it until now (I bought 
another 1G DSM recently).

Pref's menu:
* Added baud selection up to 56700 bps. This is for faster Scanmaster polling usage.
* Added MAP sensor selection. Currently it uses EGR-T input but will eventually also be used for datalogging usage with Scanmaster's 2 analog inputs... 
  aka ANA1 or ANA2.
* Added MAF Logging. You can now select 1600Hz or 3200Hz logging. It's my understanding that Keydiver is now making that 
  standard in his commercially available ROMs. However, if you're still running a non-eprom ecu or the like keep it at 1600Hz.
* Added Wideband scaling selection. Doesnt really do anything right now, but eventually using one of the analog inputs on the Scanmaster
  you'll be able to log AFR within MMCd. This assumes you have a wideband with 5v analog output. The options there are just placeholders for now.
* Added car type selection. You now can choose DSM or 3S. Currently the only thing that it changes is the timing advance display (3S's are -22
  instead of the -12 of DSM's).
* Less custom sensors. Expect those to shrink even further (perhaps 2) as I need more space on page 4. Don't really want to add a page 5 of sensors.

Main logging menu:
* Re-sorted sensors in a way that made more sense to ME and to fill out the pages better.
* For right now, flags are missing. They'll be back soon.
* Added ANA1 and ANA2 (Analog 1 and Analog 2 for Scanmaster).
* Added VSS, which only works with Scanmaster. I've been advised by Bob Bailey in the past that.. its not always 100% accurate, so YMMV.
* For right now, there only one O2 (sorry 3S owners). ASAP I'll be making the rear O2 sensor show up when you select 3S as your platform.
* Removed EGR-T and changed it to MAP. Frankly, I don't know any Cali-Car owners who look at this or will cry that its gone.

All in all, ... many things needing wrapped up.

Ver b1.70.12262004

Perf's menu:
* Removed custom sensors totally for the time being (perhaps forever?). I just really needed the form space, and I didn't want to add a page 5.
  Most people don't use custom sensors, but I know some of you developer types do. My best suggestion is use an older official version of MMCd for
  you testing needs. If this becomes a huge fiasco I'll do what I can, but right now its a bit of a coding nightmare.

Main logging menu:
* Re-added flags, someone complained they liked them. They're on page 4.

Same as above, except I fixed the changing page bug. Sorry it took so long to post!

Ver b1.70.01112005

Perf's menu:
* Updated the (i) Info for what all the sensors are a little bit.
* Readded 2 custom sensors

Main logging menu:
- I'm working on adding all the flags that seem to be somewhat useful.
* Added "Fuel Pump Relay" to FLG0. It will be denoted by an "F" switch lit up.
* Added "FLG1" to page 4, right now I only have Canister Purge (P) and CE Light (C) in that.
* Added "GREV" for stock/non expanded fuel & timing map cars. Stock g/Rev can only be logged from 0-2.06 (thats the actual limitation in the rom!) 
  That being said it behooves you to read Kyle Tarry's writeup on adding extended map functionality to your ROM. Eventually I'll add an option for 
  extended map users to also log g/Rev... thats not easy for me to test right now though, as my only eprom ecu died :( It's been sent in for 
  repair though!!!
* Readded 2 custom sensors (due to popular demand).

Ver b1.70.01122005

Main logging menu:
* Fixed g/rev
* Added Lb/min it gets calculated automatically when GREV is selected like INJD (Injector Duty %)
* Still currently only supports stock/non-extended maps for g/rev & lb/min .. its going to be some work to get that selection done. Will do ASAP.

Ver 1.71.01132005

Main logging meni:
* Fixed flag bugs (purge canister said it was on when it was off, so did AC clutch) That being said ... v1.71 is born.
